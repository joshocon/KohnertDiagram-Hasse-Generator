# KohnertPosetGenerator
This code generates the poset of a Kohenrt diagram, and tells you if it is ranked or bounded. There are optional methods to render the diagram in LaTeX.

Put initial diagrams into the diagrams.txt matching the formatting in this example:\n

(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2)\n
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)\n
(3,1) (4,1) (2,1) (2,2)\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
and so on\n
The order of cells does not matter.
