# KohnertPosetGenerator
This code generates the poset of a Kohenrt diagram, and tells you if it is ranked or bounded. There are optional methods to render the diagram in LaTeX.<br>

Put initial diagrams into the diagrams.txt matching the formatting in this example:<br>

(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (3,2)<br>
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)<br>
(3,1) (4,1) (2,1) (2,2)<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
and so on<br>
The order of cells does not matter.
